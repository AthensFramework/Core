Legible  \r\n  \r\n     *Framework* separates declaring *what elements shall be on a page* from *what those elements should look like* and the logic of *how those elements should behave*. Under this model, creating a page is not much more complicated than simply listing the presentational elements that should be present.  \r\n  \r\n  2. Extensible  \r\n  \r\n    This separation of concerns also promotes reusability of components: a web-displayed table can be turned into Excel by changing a single line of code; a web-displayed form can be presented as a PDF by changing a single line of code. Adding a column to a table takes only one line, and in most cases *Framework* will be able to populate that column from the database without any further instruction.\r\n  \r\n  3. Secure\r\n\r\n    *Framework* automatically provides strong protection against a number of web attacks, including CSRF, XSS, and database injection.  \r\n    \r\n    *Framework* also provides easy, seamless encryption for sensitive student information. Encrypting a database column requires a simple declaration in your model schema for each data-field you want to protect. Calls to and from the database on that encrypted data are transparent; *Framework* knows which fields are encrypted and handles the encryption/decryption behind the scenes.\r\n    \r\n  4. Pretty  \r\n\r\n    *Framework* includes page templates derived from the University of Washington's Boundless theme and styling. Additional user-interface elements extend that brand's base functionality. And these default templates can be easily overridden with custom themes to implement your own department or organization's brand.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis library is published on packagist. To install using Composer, add the \"uwdoem/encryption\": \">=0.2\" line to your \"require\" dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"require\": {\r\n        \"uwdoem/framework\": \">=0.2\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause Framework depends on multiple other libraries, it is *highly* recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install this library and manage dependencies.\r\n\r\nUse\r\n===\r\n\r\nInstructions to follow.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n=============\r\n\r\n* PHP 5.5, 5.6, 7.0\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n====\r\n\r\nSee GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/UWEnrollmentManagement/Framework/issues/).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n====\r\n\r\nEmployees of the University of Washington may use this code in any capacity, without reservation.
