Who This Document is Written For
--------------------------------

This document has been written for student web developers within the Office of Student Financial Aid. Many of the intern
web developers who have worked in this department have had some exposure to web development in their coursework and have
some interest in a web programming career. You may or may not have exposure to modern, industrial practices
in PHP, like ORMs, namespacing, templating, object-oriented PHP, git repositories, dependency management with
*composer*, etc. Working within this framework can be an opportunity to practice these skills.

If you're not a student developer but you are new to modern web-frameworks, then this can be your guide too.

If you're already well acquainted with modern web-frameworks, especially PHP frameworks, then please browse
these documents at your own direction. And if the typical user-base of this library has shifted towards more
experienced coders, then feel free to update these documents accordingly.
